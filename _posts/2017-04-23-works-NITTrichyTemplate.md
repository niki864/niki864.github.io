## Thesis Template

B.Tech Thesis Template for NIT-Trichy students

<div style="text-align: justify">So I created this thesis template in LaTeX as I thought formatting in Word was such a pain. Besides, LaTeX allowed me to just focus on the content and not bother about the formatting as it was all pre-defined rules. This template was created for the use of B.Tech students at the National Institute of Technology - Tiruchirappalli. I think the code is well commented and ensures that a person new to Latex will be able to modify it to suit their needs. It follows the latest thesis guidelines as specified for 2016-2017. I appreciate any comments and feedback regarding this.</div>

## Instructions

* If you're new to latex start off with main.tex and follow the comments.
* [This](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/nit-trichy-btech-thesis-template/cywtdmqjjmgr) is the overleaf link if you want to edit it online. I recommend overleaf as they have side-by-side viewer which shows you what's going on in real time. Currently my template is tracking over 1500 views!!

## Features

Here are some features of this LaTeX template.

* Table of Contents autofills.
* Images and tables are tracked and List of figures and tables autofills.
* Code can be added with syntax highlighting.
* Reference section included.
* Follows the thesis guidelines given by NITT like font size and spacing.
* Complex equations can be added easily with numbering.
